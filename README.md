### Project Details:
In this project, we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the frontend of the website.
We built APIs for a file sharing app using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. 
We used a package called __Multer__ to upload a file in Node Js.
We also used __nodemailer__ to send emails using gmail service from our node server.
We will also schedule a script on the server so we could delete 24 hours old files from the storage.
